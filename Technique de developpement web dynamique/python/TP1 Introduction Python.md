# Introduction to Python

## Getting Started with Python

Python is an interpreted programming language, which means you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then execute them using the Python interpreter. To check if Python is installed on your system, you can run `python --version` in your command line. If Python is not installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

To run a Python file, navigate to the directory containing your file and use the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```

## Python Syntax

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Key points include:

- **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Consistent indentation is crucial.
- **Line Structure**: Each line in Python is a statement. Statements do not need to end with a semicolon.

## Python Comments

Comments are used to explain code and are not executed by the interpreter. Python supports:

- **Single-line comments**: Start with a `#` symbol.
- **Multi-line comments**: Use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

## Python Variables

Variables in Python are used to store data. You do not need to declare a variable type explicitly. For example:

```python
x = 5
name = "Alice"
```

Variables can store different data types, and their type can change dynamically.
